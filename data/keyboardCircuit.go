				"Usually the microcontroller has a very limited amount of pins, less than the number of keyboard keys: in order to make it work a diode is connected to each key and a matrix arrangment of the connections is used (one pin of the MCU for each of the rows and columns of the keyboard).",
				"On each cycle the MCU scans the pins, checking if there are other pins with a signal. The scanning direction is set to 'row to column' or 'column to row'.",
				"Each switch is connected to a row pin and a column pin so that it can be identified when pressed.",
				"If (row1, col1) and (row2, col2) keys are pressed together it is possible for the MCU to also register (row1, col2) or (row2, col1): a diode on each key allows the current to flow only on one direction and prevents this effect called 'ghosting'.",
			},
		},
		{
			TextList: []string{
				"Given N number of free MCU pins, the maximum number of keyboard keys that can be registered using a regular matrix scanning method is (N/2)*(N/2) with (N/2) rows and (N/2) columns.",
				"This number can be doubled using a duplex matrix: the scanning goes both way and for each (row, col) pair there are 2 switches. The difference between these 2 switches is the orientation of the diodes (row2col or col2row).",
